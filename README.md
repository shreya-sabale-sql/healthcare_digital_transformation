# 🏥 Healthcare Digital Transformation
Business Analyst Case Study

# 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Business Analyst–led digital transformation initiative for a healthcare organization.
The goal was to analyze existing manual workflows, identify operational inefficiencies, and design a technology-driven solution using EMR and automation.

The project simulates a real-world healthcare transformation case, focusing on:

Process improvement

Stakeholder management

Business requirements gathering

Digital enablement

Change management

# 🎯 Problem Statement

The hospital was facing the following challenges:

Long patient waiting times

Manual and error-prone record keeping

Poor coordination between departments

Delays in patient treatment

Inefficient inventory management

# 📌 Objective:
To digitally transform hospital operations using EMR systems, automation, and data-driven decision-making.

# 📚 Project Scope
# ✅ In Scope

Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

Patient registration automation

Inter-department communication

Pharmacy & inventory automation

Process optimization

# ❌ Out of Scope

Clinical diagnosis

Medical treatment protocols

Facility infrastructure upgrades
